**TECHNOLOGY**

To give users a better experience, we decided to go with the latest technology for developing this application.

_Frontend_

For the front-end, we will be using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap. This enables cross-platform development, which allows the web app to be compatible with both PC and mobile platforms. It also gives a more premium user interface and smoother experience.

_Backend_

Python&#39;s web framework - Django will be used as the website&#39;s backend. Django ensures rapid development providing high security and maintenance.

_Database_

We will be using MySql as the database. MySql uses JSON to store data and provides high performance, availability and automatic scaling.

_Payment method_

For collecting payment, we will use Python&#39;s Stripe Library. This API is designed with python and allows custom ways to take payments – Credit cards, Gift cards etc. We will be using this API to ensure that users can pay using their Visa Cards,bKash, Rocket, Nogod, American Express, and MasterCards.

_Additional technologies_

Django will be used to allow users to login using their Facebook and/or Google account.

**Monetization:**

Maintaining this web application and maturing this will cost money. For this purpose, Users have to buy subscriptions with a minimal amount of money. As this web application is developed for a community group, some basic features will be free of charge for use. There will be some premium features available for paid users, which will be our costing&#39;s source income.

**Database:**

For the database part, we choose to go with MySQL. MySQL is the most popular Open Source Relational SQL Database Management System. MySQL is one of the best RDBMS being used for developing various web-based software applications.

**Social Impact:**

People with more severe forms of mental illness have smaller social networks than others and have more family members than friends in their social circle. People with smaller social networks, with fewer intimate relationships, find it more difficult to manage social situations. To overcome this problems our web-App will help people to get rid of mental illness .
