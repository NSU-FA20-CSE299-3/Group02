<p id="#introduction"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>

To help people get rid of these outrageous things, we have come up with this web application Mukto Batash.</p>

<p id="technology"><strong>3. TECHNOLOGY</strong></p>

<p>3.1 Proposed Technology Stack: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Frontend</em></p>
<p>For the front-end, we will be using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap. This enables cross-platform development, which allows the web app to be compatible with both PC and mobile platforms. It also gives a more premium user interface and smoother experience.</p>

<p><em>Backend</em></p>
<p>Python&#39;s web framework - Django will be used as the website&#39;s backend. Django ensures rapid development providing high security and maintenance.</p>

<p><em>Database</em></p>
<p>We will be using MySql as the database. MySql uses JSON to store data and provides high performance, availability and automatic scaling.</p>

<p><em>Payment method</em></p>
<p>For collecting payment, we will use Python&#39;s Stripe Library. This API is designed with python and allows custom ways to take payments – Credit cards, Gift cards etc. We will be using this API to ensure that users can pay using their Visa Cards,bKash, Rocket, Nogod, American Express, and MasterCards.</p>

<p><em>Additional technologies</em></p>
<p>Django will be used to allow users to login using their Facebook and/or Google account.</p>

<p id="businessplan"><strong>MONETIZATION</strong></p>

<p>Maintaining this web application and maturing this will cost money. For this purpose, Users have to buy subscriptions with a minimal amount of money. As this web application is developed for a community group, some basic features will be free of charge for use. There will be some premium features available for paid users, which will be our costing&#39;s source income.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Addiction is something where people becomes blind and does the wrong thing by thinking that it is right. Which leads them to criminal acts in our society. With this app we can help them to get back to their normal and happy life. By bringing them back to their old life, we can significantly reduce criminal action in our society.</p>
